### Hello there

My name is Hugo Pereira, I have graduated in physics from the University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Currently I work as a software quality engineer with a focus on performance and automation. I'm passionate about combining my physics background with software engineering to optimize systems and enhance their efficiency.

During my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong interest in nuclear physics, particularly in the field of Ion Beam Analysis, such as PIXE (Particle-Induced X-ray Emission). I also explored topics related to particle accelerators and educational technologies. Throughout my academic journey, I extensively utilized Python as my primary programming language, along with popular libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, and Scipy. Additionally, I gained proficiency in SQL, predominantly with MySQL, and engaged in parallel programming using C++.


I've also published some few things in the recent years, you can find them here:
