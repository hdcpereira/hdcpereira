### Hello there

My name is Hugo Pereira (He/Him) , I'm currently an undergraduate physics student at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I'm interested in nuclear physics (mainly Ion Beam Analysis e.g. PIXE), particle acelereators, data science, data analysis and educational technologies. My main programming language is `Python` (and its libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Scipy) with experience using SQL (mostly, MySQL) and parallel programing with `C++`. I have been studing `Julia`, Docker, Grafana and its applications.

I've also published some few things in the recent years, you can find them here:
